# SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) 22 Installation Checklist

This checklist documents exactly what to select during installation of SSMS 22 when installing it for use with a local SQL Server Developer Edition instance.

---

## 1. Launch the SSMS Installer

1. Run the SSMS setup executable you downloaded from Microsoft.
2. Wait for the installer to load the component selection screen.

---

## 2. Core Components

On the right-hand side, confirm the following is selected:

- SSMS Core Components

This is the only component required for:
- Connecting to SQL Server
- Running queries
- Exploring databases and objects
- Managing SQL Server configurations
- Performing admin tasks

No other selections are required for normal SQL Server work.

---

## 3. Optional Workloads (Do Not Select Unless Needed)

The installer shows four optional workloads on the left:

1. AI Assistance  
2. Business Intelligence  
3. Hybrid and Migration  
4. Code Tools  

For a standard SQL Server learning and development environment:

- Leave all four unchecked.

Notes:

- Business Intelligence does not install SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT).  
- AI Assistance is optional and not required for database work.  
- Hybrid and Migration tools are only used for enterprise migrations to Azure or newer SQL versions.  
- Code Tools are optional enhancements, not required for everyday SQL work.

---

## 4. Installation Location

Leave the default location: C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 22\


Unless you have a specific reason to install elsewhere.

---

## 5. Installation Mode

At the bottom-right of the installer:

- Choose "Install while downloading" (default and recommended).
- Click Install.

Total space required is typically around 2.2 GB.

---

## 6. After Installation

When SSMS completes installation:

1. Launch SQL Server Management Studio.
2. Connect to your SQL Server instance.

### Test Windows Authentication:

- Server type: Database Engine  
- Server name: `localhost`  
- Authentication: Windows Authentication  
- Click Connect  

### Test SQL Authentication:

- Disconnect and reconnect using:  
  - Server name: `localhost`  
  - Login: `sa`  
  - Password: (the one created during SQL Server installation)  

This confirms Mixed Mode authentication is working.

---

## 7. Optional Follow-up Installs

If you later need advanced BI or data integration capabilities:

- Install SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) via Visual Studio Installer for:  
  - SSIS development  
  - SSAS Tabular/Multidimensional models  
  - SSRS report creation  

These are not part of SSMS.

---

## Summary

Minimum required for a fully functional SQL Server GUI:

- SSMS Core Components only  
- No optional workloads selected  
- Defaults accepted  
- Installation complete  

This results in a clean, lightweight SSMS installation suitable for development, training, and database administration.
